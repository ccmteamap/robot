# Project team CCMAP
## Project description
Design and build a robot that drives from the starting position to the water source on the other side of the contest area and fill  bucket with water, drive the bucket with water back through the contest area which has obstacles on the floor and deposit the water in the water collection tower on the “fire” location.
The robot must be working autonomously when it is in the contest area. It is not allowed to “help” the robot while in the contest area. If the robot gets stuck the teams are allowed to stop the robot and move the robot back to the start position from which the robot can be restarted with an empty bucket. The robot can make multiple runs collecting and delivering water within the duration of 5 minutes. The water must be transported in an open bucket, covering the bucket is not allowed, it is not allowed to re-use water spilled from the bucket. It is only allowed to transport the water inside the bucket.
